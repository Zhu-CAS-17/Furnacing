frequency of induction heating
coil_xx0, coil_yy0,coil_dxx,width_coil,xx_r,yy_r
coil_xx0: coordinate in vertical direction old value: -0.019 

use new value: 20+315-(12+270+90)=-37
12: thickness of container
270: height of elevator
80: thickness of insulation below susceptor
315: height of coil from desktop

how about assume the coil_xx0 is 0.01 lower, and with a gap 0.01/4 larger
orig: coil_xx0=-0.037 coil_dxx=0.05
coil_xx0=-0.047 coil_dxx=0.055
