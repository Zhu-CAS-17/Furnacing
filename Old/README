1. generate the initial coordinatary nodes (a common zone mark, namely reference grid);
2. define and set the nodes pattern which will be used in the following computing;
3. make an index for each nodes according to my computing method needing;
4. built all the necessary physical field;
5. initial those physical value using every boundary and initial conditions;
6. calculate the generated mesh information based on the simulating method (every diserate equation coefficience at each nodes);
7. establish the node control diserate equation;
8. integrate the whole matrix equation at each stage;
9. design and create the equation solvers and some math operator code implemention.
